"""Climate platform for Jung Home (Thermostat / room temperature regulator).

A ``Thermostat`` function exposes three datapoints (see
``cdb_types_datapoints.json`` / ``cdb_types_functions.json``):

- ``temperature_ctrl`` — the target temperature in °C (range 5..30) plus a
  ``temperature_ctrl_preset`` key. Writes accept exactly ``frost`` / ``eco`` /
  ``comfort``; reads report the matching preset or ``""`` when the target
  matches no threshold. (The gateway's API descriptor also advertises
  ``none``, but the firmware rejects writing it and never reports it — see
  the preset note in ``docs/gateway-websocket.md``.)
- ``quantity`` — the room temperature reading, surfaced here as
  ``current_temperature``. (Sensor discovery does not turn a Thermostat's
  quantity into a standalone sensor entity; it is only the ambient reading.)
- ``switch`` — despite the datapoint *type* name, **not** the thermostat's
  on/off. It is the room regulator's momentary activity, surfaced here as
  ``hvac_action`` (heating / idle), never as ``hvac_mode``.

**The regulator has no on/off, so the entity is permanently ``HVACMode.HEAT``.**
The gateway builds a Thermostat from exactly three device *states* — setpoint,
ambient temperature and ``automatic_mode`` (``JungHome_Thermostat`` in
``jung-home-device.js``) — and re-labels the third as a ``switch`` datapoint on
the way to the API (``datapoint_helper_methods.js``). None of them turns the
regulator off; the closest equivalent is the ``frost`` preset. Reading that
datapoint as an off/on mode is what made every thermostat flip between ``off``
and ``heat`` several times an hour while its configuration never changed (issue
#121) — the value tracks the device's momentary heating output. Full firmware
evidence is in the Thermostat note in ``docs/gateway-websocket.md``.

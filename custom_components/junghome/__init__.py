# Consecutive polls a device must be absent from before it is pruned. The
# gateway occasionally returns a partial device list on a single poll (notably
# right after a reload); pruning on the first miss would delete a live device's
# entities — and because identity is label-derived, the platform would then
# re-create them under whatever label the next poll reports, losing the user's
# entity_id/customisations. Requiring persistence rides out a transient blip.
#
# The threshold is deliberately generous (10 polls ~ 10 minutes). Removal is
# destructive and irreversible from the user's side — it takes the entity
# registry entries with it, so custom names, areas and entity_ids are lost and
# automations referencing them break — while the cost of removing late is only
# that a device the user deleted in the app lingers for a few extra minutes.
# Home Assistant core integrations that prune do so on the *first* miss, but
# they trust their hub's device list; this gateway is documented above as
# occasionally returning a partial one, so the same confidence isn't available.
# (Verified against gateway firmware: the middleware maps every known device
# into the function list with no `isOnline` filter — disk_dump sdc2
# `function_helper_methods.js`, `createFunctionListByDevices` — so an
# unreachable BT-Mesh device is NOT omitted from `/functions/`; it just
# reports stale/`"NaN"` values. Absence therefore means deleted/relabelled,
# or a partial poll — which is what this debounce rides out.)

#   * Home Assistant refusing a registry write because the target unique_id or
#     identifier is already claimed (ValueError, HomeAssistantError).

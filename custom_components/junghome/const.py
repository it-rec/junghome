# mainly reduces gateway load; live value updates keep arriving over the
# WebSocket regardless. The bounds are enforced in the options form AND
# re-clamped when the coordinator reads the stored option (an option written by
# an older version, or edited by hand, must not produce a torrent of requests
# or an effectively-disabled backstop):
# - The floor matches the fetch's own 30 s `asyncio.timeout` — a shorter
#   interval could not complete a slow fetch before the next one is due.

# case-insensitive substrings of the (English) label the gateway reports, e.g.
# "Presence Detected". ("Present Illuminance" has unit "lux" and the substring

    used as the identity anchor. Falls back to the volatile id only if the label
    is missing or unsluggable.

    The fallback inspects the slug *result*, not the raw candidate: HA's
    ``slugify`` maps symbol/whitespace-only strings (e.g. ``"❤"`` or ``"   "``)
    to the literal string ``"unknown"`` rather than an empty string. A naive
    ``label or id`` check never reaches the id fallback for such labels (the
    truthy ``"unknown"`` short-circuits it) and lets two unsluggable labels
    collide on ``"unknown"``. So each candidate is slugified in turn and the
    first non-empty, non-``"unknown"`` slug wins.

    Known limitation (accepted gateway constraint, not disambiguated here):
    two devices with identical — or identically-slugging — labels (e.g.
    ``"Lamp 1"`` vs ``"Lamp-1"``, both ``"lamp_1"``) produce the same slug and
    therefore the same ``stable_unique_id``. Because the gateway exposes no
    hardware id, the second device silently loses (its entity can't register).
    Per-poll disambiguation is deliberately *not* done — it would make
    unique_ids depend on poll order/membership, breaking the stable-identity
    invariant.

    ## migration note
    This change alters ``device_slug`` (and thus ``unique_id``s) only for
    devices whose label was previously symbol/whitespace-only and mapped to
    ``"unknown"`` — already-broken edge cases. Well-labelled devices are

    That is survivable for identity, but **any caller keeping per-device state

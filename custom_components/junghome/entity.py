"""Shared base entity for Jung Home device platforms.

Every device-backed platform (light, switch, sensor, event, cover, climate)
repeated the same ``device_info``, ``available`` and coordinator-data lookups.
This base centralises them. The scene platform is intentionally *not* based on
it — scenes have no backing device.

``available`` keys off the coordinator's ``last_update_success`` signal, and
the lookup helpers return the same objects the inline ``next(...)`` calls did.
``device_info`` additionally links each device to the synthetic gateway (hub)
device via ``via_device``. Subclasses keep their own ``unique_id``/naming and
their own ``_handle_coordinator_update`` write logic (which intentionally
differs between platforms).

        which would re-arm the poll timer and starve the poll — see
        ``_handle_websocket_message``). So it reads True while either the poll
        succeeds or pushes arrive, and flips False within about one poll
        interval plus the 30 s timeout once the gateway is truly gone.

        their last polled state but cannot be actuated, so they read
        unavailable rather than accept commands that would silently fail.

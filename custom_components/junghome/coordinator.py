RECONNECT_JITTER = 0.5
# Consecutive failed reconnects before raising a repair issue, following the core
# convention of bounding push failures. Below this the backoff has waited well
# under a minute in total, which an ordinary blip (gateway reboot, Wi-Fi hiccup)
# rides out silently; past it the gateway has been unreachable long enough that
# the user is unknowingly running on the 60 s REST poll and deserves to be told.
MAX_RECONNECT_FAILURES = 5
# How long a session must stay up before it counts as a genuine recovery rather
# than a flap. Resetting the backoff at the moment of connect made the escalation
# unreachable: a gateway that accepts the upgrade and drops us immediately (a
# reboot loop, a websocket server restart cycle, a client limit) would reconnect
# roughly once a second forever, never raising the repair issue and flapping every
# controllable entity. A session shorter than this is treated as a failed attempt.
STABLE_SESSION_SECONDS = 30
# Bound for the WebSocket handshake. Home Assistant's shared session carries
# aiohttp's default ClientTimeout(total=300, sock_connect=30), so a gateway that
# accepts the TCP connection and then says nothing parks the reconnect loop for a
# full five minutes: no retry, no failure counted, no progress toward the repair
# issue, and every controllable entity unavailable throughout. A gateway on the
# LAN either answers quickly or is not answering.
WS_CONNECT_TIMEOUT = 30
# Bound for a single outbound frame. `send_str` awaits the transport drain and
# has no timeout of its own, so a peer that stops reading can block the calling
# service call indefinitely. Short, because this is a LAN write of a few bytes.
WS_SEND_TIMEOUT = 10
# Bound for awaiting the gateway's confirmation of a datapoint set. A successful
# set is answered with a `datapoint` reply that echoes the request's
# `message_id` (firmware-verified, websocket-server-service.js); the middleware
# itself gives up waiting on the BT-Mesh node after
# `config.btmesh.response_timeout_ms` = 3000 ms (config.json) before the set
# rejects and the reply never comes, so this leaves comfortable headroom above
# that mesh-level bound for the WS round trip. Waiting longer would buy
# nothing: the api-server abandons its middleware IPC call at
# `middleware.command_timeout_ms` = 6000 ms (api-server config.json), and the
# middleware's own retry loop (3 attempts, 3 s apart) means a set that did not
# succeed on the first mesh attempt cannot answer inside that bound either —
# so every reply that will ever arrive does so within ~3.5 s. A rejected set
# produces only an uncorrelated `error:` message frame (no message_id to match
# against — see `_dispatch_text_frame`), so a rejection surfaces here as a
# timeout rather than the gateway's specific error text.

      infinity. ``math.isfinite`` screens them out first so the intent is
